# Task 2: User Engagement Analysis Report

## Objective
Develop a comprehensive user engagement analysis framework to extract meaningful insights from telecom data, focusing on user behavior, traffic patterns, and advanced analytics.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation
- Loaded XDR (eXtended Detail Record) data from Parquet file
- Converted numeric columns to appropriate data types
- Handled missing values ('\\N') by replacing with '0'
- Created derived columns for analysis

### 2. User Engagement Metrics
#### Key Metrics Calculated
- **Session Frequency**: Number of sessions per user
- **Total Duration**: Cumulative session duration
- **Traffic Volume**: 
  - Download bytes
  - Upload bytes
  - Total traffic

### 3. Advanced Analytics Techniques

#### User Clustering
- Implemented K-means clustering to segment users
- Used features:
  - Session frequency
  - Total traffic
  - Average session duration

#### Top User Identification
- Developed methods to identify top users by:
  - Total traffic
  - Session frequency
  - Application-specific usage

### 4. Visualization and Reporting
- Created interactive Streamlit dashboard
- Implemented visualizations for:
  - User engagement distribution
  - Traffic patterns
  - Top user insights

## Key Challenges and Solutions
1. **Data Type Inconsistency**
   - Challenge: Inconsistent column names and data types
   - Solution: Implemented robust data type conversion and column name mapping

2. **Missing Value Handling**
   - Challenge: Presence of '\\N' values
   - Solution: Replaced '\\N' with '0' and used `errors='coerce'` in numeric conversions

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components
- `user_engagement.py`: Main analysis logic
- `dashboard.py`: Interactive visualization
- `data_preparation.py`: Data loading and preprocessing

### Key Methods
- `aggregate_engagement_metrics()`: Calculates user-level metrics
- `cluster_users()`: Segments users using machine learning
- `get_top_users()`: Identifies top performers

## Insights and Recommendations

### User Segmentation
- Identified distinct user groups based on engagement levels
- Potential for targeted marketing and service improvements

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient data processing using pandas aggregations
- Modular, reusable code structure

## Future Work
- Implement more advanced clustering algorithms
- Develop predictive models for user churn
- Enhance dashboard with more interactive features

## Conclusion
Task 2 successfully transformed raw telecom data into actionable user engagement insights, providing a robust framework for understanding user behavior and network usage patterns.
